# Module2Challenge

To complete this challenge, my course instructor provided the class a skeleton code, which was used extensively in my final VBA script. I also used study groups to troubleshoot my code. For formulas that were not included in the course materials, I used online resources to help me write the code. 

The final VBA script analyzes stock data from 2018, 2019, and 2020, organizes the data into columns, as well as determines which stock had the greatest percentage increase and decrease. 
The VBA script runs on every worksheet in the Excel file.
